{"name":"howdowework.com","tagline":"howdowework.com will be a interesting website that will help employees to give feedback for different companies.","body":"# Welcome to howdowework.com\r\n\r\nSoon... howdowework.com will change the way we work !\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Mission\r\n\r\nThe objective of this website is to ensure the business collaboration satisfaction.\r\nAn employee will be able , after he ended up a contract or a collaboration with a company, to leave some feedback to the company. This way, a new employee that wants to find a new job , will be able to have a clear overview of that the public opinions are. \r\n\r\n### Benefits for the employee\r\n\r\nThe employee who wants to hire or establish a contract with a company, can easily search howdowework.com for feedback (Before going to an interview or being involved into a recruitment process).\r\n\r\nAn employee who **works/worked** with the company for which **he/she** wants to leave a feedback **and/or** a story must have an account on howdowework.com .  \r\n\r\nAn identity verification of the account is optional, and the user will receive additional points/badges which we'll be able to supply in the future.\r\n\r\nA person can say anything **he/she** wants about the company but only if he has an account on howdowework.com.\r\n\r\nEg : An employee that used to work for a company, _knows what he's talking about_ rather than a friend of an angry employee is not eligible to speak in his name. That's why we require a registered user.\r\n\r\nHowever, the account data will remain confidential between the employee and howdowework.com , so any user can reserve the right to remain anonymous on a public feedback.\r\n\r\nAny other people that will want to add some stories about the company will have a different section for that. Eg : Sofia didn't work at Cegeka, but her boyfriend did. She has a special section where she is able to post a story like . _\" A great company, my bf was really happy about ... etc... \"_\r\n\r\n### Employer benefits\r\n\r\nThe website objective is to help the employees more than companies, but the company is also able to add feedback to a person. _( Of course, feedback to your profile will be visible just with your approval )._\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more info, contact me : _enescu.mihai@outlook.com_ and I will answer all your questions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
