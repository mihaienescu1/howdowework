<p>Soon... howdowework.com will change the way we work !</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="mission" class="anchor" href="#mission"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission</h3>

<p>The objective of this website is to ensure the business collaboration satisfaction.
An employee will be able , after he ended up a contract or a collaboration with a company, to leave some feedback to the company. This way, a new employee that wants to find a new job , will be able to have a clear overview of that the public opinions are. </p>

<h3>
<a name="benefits-for-the-employee" class="anchor" href="#benefits-for-the-employee"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits for the employee</h3>

<p>The employee who wants to hire or establish a contract with a company, can easily search howdowework.com for feedback (Before going to an interview or being involved into a recruitment process).</p>

<p>An employee who <strong>works/worked</strong> with the company for which <strong>he/she</strong> wants to leave a feedback <strong>and/or</strong> a story must have an account on howdowework.com .  </p>

<p>An identity verification of the account is optional, and the user will receive additional points/badges which we'll be able to supply in the future.</p>

<p>A person can say anything <strong>he/she</strong> wants about the company but only if he has an account on howdowework.com.</p>

<p>Eg : An employee that used to work for a company, <em>knows what he's talking about</em> rather than a friend of an angry employee is not eligible to speak in his name. That's why we require a registered user.</p>

<p>However, the account data will remain confidential between the employee and howdowework.com , so any user can reserve the right to remain anonymous on a public feedback.</p>

<p>Any other people that will want to add some stories about the company will have a different section for that. Eg : Sofia didn't work at Cegeka, but her boyfriend did. She has a special section where she is able to post a story like . <em>" A great company, my bf was really happy about ... etc... "</em></p>

<p>The website objective is to help the employees more than companies, but the company is also able to add feedback to a person. <em>( Of course, feedback to your profile will be visible just with your approval ).</em></p>
