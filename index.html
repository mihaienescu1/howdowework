<p>The objective of this website is to ensure the business collaboration satisfaction.
An employee will be able , after he ended up a contract or a collaboration with a company, to leave some feedback to the company. This way, a new employee that wants to find a new job , will be able to have a clear overview of that the public opinions are. </p>

<h3>
<a name="benefits-for-the-employee" class="anchor" href="#benefits-for-the-employee"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits for the employee</h3>

<p>The employee who will want to hire or establish a contract with a "company" , can easily search howdowework.com for the opinions ( Before going to an interview or running a recruitment process ) .</p>

<p>An employee who works/worked for the company for which he/she wants to leave a feedback and/or a story must prove to howdowework.com that this information is true. For some people this verification can be frustrating but we need to have accurate information and avoid any potential spams and multi-user accounts created by revenge. A person can say anything he/she wants about the company but only if it's totally eligible to speak. Eg : An employee that worked for the company knows what he's talking about , rather than a friend of an angry employee is not eligible to do that.</p>

<p>However, the proofs will remain confidential between the employee and howdowework.com , so any user can reserve the right to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>Any other people that will want to put some opinions about the company will have a different section for this .</p>

<h3>
<a name="employer-benefits" class="anchor" href="#employer-benefits"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Employer benefits</h3>

<p>The website is more built to to help the employee but the company , also can add feedback to the person . A company representative can add a response at each feedback story. 
A website client can build his resume / work history !!!</p>
